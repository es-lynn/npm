The goal is to come up with a process / formula / automation that everyone can follow to solve a particular problem.

1. We have work that needs to be done
2. Everyone else appears to have the same work that needs to be done
3. Is there a standard out there? The answer is probably yes. Find and use it.
4. See if it can be automated
5. Write a document so everyone can follow it now
